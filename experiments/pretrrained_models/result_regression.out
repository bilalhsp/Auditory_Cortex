/home/ahmedb/.conda/envs/cent7/2020.11-py38/wav2letter/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torchmetrics/utilities/prints.py:36: UserWarning: Torchmetrics v0.9 introduced a new argument class property called `full_state_update` that has
                not been set for this class (WordErrorRate). The property determines if `update` by
                default needs access to the full metric state. If this is not the case, significant speedups can be
                achieved and we recommend setting this to `False`.
                We provide an checking function
                `from torchmetrics.utilities import check_forward_no_full_state`
                that can be used to check if the `full_state_update=True` (old and potential slower behaviour,
                default for now) or if `full_state_update=False` can be used safely.

/home/ahmedb/.conda/envs/cent7/2020.11-py38/wav2letter/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/_tensor.py:575: UserWarning: floor_divide is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version of pytorch. It currently rounds toward 0 (like the 'trunc' function NOT 'floor'). This results in incorrect rounding for negative values.
To keep the current behavior, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='trunc'), or for actual floor division, use torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='floor'). (Triggered internally at  /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1623448278899/work/aten/src/ATen/native/BinaryOps.cpp:467.)
